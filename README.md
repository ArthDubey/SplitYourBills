# Aim
Payment distribution console based application.

This Project aims to build an image classifier that requires substiantially low computational power and is extremely high paced.
However the trade off being that it's accuracy is somewhere around 76-81%. This is suitable for general purpose uses in heavy
pipelines where computational power is the bottleneck.
